# Stewart-portfolio
Welcome to Will Stewart's portfolio for Advanced GIS. 

# About Me
I am a second-year MSPPM student with a budding passion for spatial analysis and how it can be applied to urban development. Specifically, I am interested in land use planning and how communities can capitalize on their existing assets. In my free time, I enjoy discovering new music, cooking vegetarian meals, and waiting for the Detroit Pistons to be decent again. I have also become more interested in hiking and taking long walks around Pittsburgh. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to develop a deeper understanding of network analysis and remote sensing. I also want to improve the design of maps, like adding unique symbols and fonts to maps. Lastly, I hope to use GIS to map vacant land space and calculate the most efficient uses of the space to best serve the community.
